                <p> 
                    For internal wash, we'll want to focus on vacuuming the seats, floors,
                    and mats, wiping down all surfaces, cleaning the windows,
                    and making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies. 
                    It's all about attention to detail to make the interior look and feel fresh!

                <h2>External Wash</h2>
                <p> 
                    For external wash, we'd start by rinsing off any loose dirt,
                    then wash it with a car-specific soap, scrubbing gently. After that, rinse the car again,
                    and dry it with a clean microfiber towel to avoid water spots. For an extra touch,
                    you could apply tire shine and wax the car for a protective finish. 
                    It's all about making the car look its best!ðŸš˜âœ¨
